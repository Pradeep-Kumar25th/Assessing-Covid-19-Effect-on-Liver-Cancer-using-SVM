Predict the effect of Covid-19 on liver cancer using SVM classifier. Dataset - covid-liver.csv
This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of COVID-19 on liver cancer using machine learning model.Data of patients diagnosed forboth COVID-19 and liver cancer were collected and  analyzed  to  develop  the  SVM  model.  The  model  was  then  used  to  predict  the  potential impact of COVID-19 on liver cancer outcomes. We used dataset containing characteristics of the patients   with   symptoms   of   cancer,   and   we   applied   a SVM   (Support   Vector   Machine)classification  model.   The  results  of  this  study  suggest  that  COVID-19  may  have  a  significant impact on liver cancer, and that the SVM model can be a useful tool for predicting the effects of the  disease  on  this  type  of  cancer. Data  cleaning,  data  preparation,  feature  engineering,  and model  implementation  procedures  have  all  been  carried  out  using  the  Python  programming language and libraries (Sklearn, and Keras). Our empirical results show that the machine learning classification  model's  accuracy  rises,  suggesting  that machinelearning  models  may  perform better than regression-based methods.
